# MonteCarlo - PI
Estimate the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method.

We have a circle enclosed by a square whose sides are equal to the diameter of the circle. Generating a large number of uniformly distributed random points and plot them onto the square (the accuracy of the estimation will increase proportionally to the number points that we generate), we can get the value of PI/4 if we divide the number of points that fall within the circle by the total number of points generated.

Check out a [Live Demo](https://harish.tech/projects/MonteCarloPI/) of the implementation

[This](mcpi.java) is the Java port of the code.
